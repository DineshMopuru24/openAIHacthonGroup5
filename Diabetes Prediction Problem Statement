Problem Statement: Diabetes Risk Prediction

Background
Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of diabetes are crucial for managing the disease and preventing complications. Traditionally, diabetes diagnosis involves various clinical tests and observations of symptoms. However, leveraging machine learning techniques can significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the diagnosis process.
Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a person has diabetes based on a set of clinical features and symptoms. The model will be trained using a dataset containing patient information such as age, gender, and various symptoms related to diabetes.
Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:
•	Age: Age of the patient
•	Gender: Gender of the patient (Male/Female)
•	Polyuria: Frequent urination (Yes/No)
•	Polydipsia: Increased thirst (Yes/No)
•	Sudden weight loss: Sudden loss of weight (Yes/No)
•	Weakness: General weakness (Yes/No)
•	Polyphagia: Increased appetite (Yes/No)
•	Genital thrush: Genital thrush (Yes/No)
•	Visual blurring: Blurred vision (Yes/No)
•	Itching: Itching (Yes/No)
•	Irritability: Irritability (Yes/No)
•	Delayed healing: Delayed healing of wounds (Yes/No)
•	Partial paresis: Partial paralysis (Yes/No)
•	Muscle stiffness: Muscle stiffness (Yes/No)
•	Alopecia: Hair loss (Yes/No)
•	Obesity: Obesity (Yes/No)
•	Class: Target variable indicating diabetes status (Positive/Negative)
Methodology
The methodology for developing the diabetes prediction model involves the following steps:
1.	Data Collection: The dataset containing patient information and symptoms will be collected and preprocessed.
2.	Data Preprocessing: The dataset will undergo preprocessing steps such as encoding categorical variables and splitting into training and validation sets.
3.	Model Training: An XGBoost classifier will be trained on the preprocessed training data.
4.	Model Evaluation: The trained model will be evaluated on the validation set using accuracy as the primary metric.
5.	Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters to improve performance (optional but recommended for better results).
6.	Documentation: Documenting the process, results, and conclusions.
Expected Outcome
The expected outcome is a machine learning model that can accurately predict diabetes status with a high degree of accuracy. This model can potentially assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and management of diabetes, leading to better patient outcomes.
